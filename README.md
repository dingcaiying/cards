> ## Poker Hand Evaluator Challenge
>
> See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hand_categories
>
> In a programming language of your choosing, create a web-based or CLI program that allows a user to enter two poker hands, then correctly reports which of the two is stronger.
>
> CLI example*

> ```
> $ ./poker-hands
> Enter a hand
> >>> 9, 10, J, Q, K
> Enter another hand
> >>> A, A, A, A, 2
> >>> [A, A, A, A, 2] is the stronger hand!
> ```


>  Rules and guidelines
>  - Disregard suits (i.e., diamonds, clubs, hearts, spades)
>  - Disregard flushes (the user can't enter a suit, anyway)
>  - The Joker card (J) is not allowed
>  - The program must reject impossible hands


>  ```
>  Enter a hand
>  >>> A, A, A, A, A
>  >>> Impossible hand!
>  >>> Enter a hand
>  >>>
>  ```
